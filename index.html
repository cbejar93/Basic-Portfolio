<p>Hi! I'm Carlos! I'm an up and coming web developer.<br> I like to eat and jump head first into new things. Graduated from the University of Central Florida
, I studied Political Science and Urban Planning in 2016. <br> I'm really excited to get into the Web Development, and create really cool things! Easy going and love to chit chat </p>
 <br> I've worked on political campaigns before and really enjoyed the hard work. I'd be a great fit anywhere!
